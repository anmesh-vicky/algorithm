**HEAP SORT**
*steps*
- Build the max-heap
- Swap the root element to child node and remove it again build max heap and again remove recursion it will go and you will get the sorted array
- Time Complexity: Time complexity of heapify is O(Logn). Time complexity of createAndBuildHeap() is O(n) and overall time complexity of Heap Sort is O(nLogn).
